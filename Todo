TODO list for Perl module Test::MockRandom

- Write better documentation for usage

- Write a matching "unimport"?

#--------------------------------------------------------------------------#
Interface brainstorming:

use Test::MockRandom override => 'Some::Module';
use Test::MockRandom override => [ qw( Some::Module Some::OtherModule ) ];
use Test::MockRandom override => 'Some::Module';
use Test::MockRandom qw( Some::Module Some::Other::Module );

a) Called with no arguments

use Test::MockRandom; # imports rand and srand to current package

b) Called with empty list argument

use Test::MockRandom (); # imports nothing -> for object usage in current package

c) Called with module names as arguments

use Test::MockRandom qw( Some::Module Some::Other::Module );

Imports srand to current package and exports rand to named modules => for remote overriding of rand

Can import to current module as well with 

use Test::MockRandom __PACKAGE__, qw( Some::Module );

(Make it smart enough so that "use Test::MockRandom qw( __PACKAGE__, Some::Module );" works, too

Can override globally with 

use Test::MockRandom 'CORE::GLOBAL';
