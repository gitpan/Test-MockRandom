If this is still here it means the programmer was too lazy to create the readme file.

You can create it now by using the command shown below from this directory:

pod2text Test::MockRandom > README

At the very least you should be able to use this set of instructions
to install the module...
perl Build.PL
./Build
./Build test
./Build install
